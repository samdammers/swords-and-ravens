/// for a game the user had joined as a replacer - see UserStatsService.RecalculateAsync). On the

/// player-for-player replace vote) pushes the removed user's id into one of those arrays, so a
/// null Reason on a row created by the live endpoint (<see cref="ReplacedAt"/> set) only ever
/// happens for the now-fixed lobby-seat-change bug. The historical backfill can also leave Reason
